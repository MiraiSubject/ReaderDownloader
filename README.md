# Reader Downloader for Leiden University (Webextension)

Easily download the PDF version of your purchased reader from Leiden Online Reader.

## Why?

The online reader is very restrictive in what you can do: 

- Unable to select text
- Page navigation is slow
- CSS on webpage is bad to the point that a small window makes the notes bigger than the actual PDF file

There's also no native way to download the PDF to use it offline. I believe we should have access to our readers locally and just in the paper variant.

## How to use

Download the extension from here: 


Or build it yourself: 

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```
